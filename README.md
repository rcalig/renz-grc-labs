**ðŸš€ GRC Engineering Learning Journey**

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey from Cyber GRC â†’ GRC Engineering, where I focus on automating controls, applying policy as code, and integrating compliance into CI/CD pipelines.

The goal is to show how GRC can scale through engineering practices â€” bridging governance with DevOps, and enabling secure velocity.
