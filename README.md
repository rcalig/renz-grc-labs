**ðŸš€ GRC Engineering Learning Journey**

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey from Cyber GRC â†’ GRC Engineering, where I focus on automating controls, applying policy as code, and integrating compliance into CI/CD pipelines.

The goal is to show how GRC can scale through engineering practices â€” bridging governance with DevOps, and enabling secure velocity.

**ðŸ“Œ About Me**

Cyber GRC professional moving into GRC Engineering.

Background: Third-Party Risk Management, Cyber Controls Testing and Assurance, Cyber KPI and Executive/Board-level Reporting
Current focus: Policy as Code, Evidence Automation, CI/CD Controls, and GitHub/GitLab Integration.

**ðŸ—‚ Curriculum Roadmap**

This repo is structured as a week-by-week set of labs, moving from beginner â†’ expert level.

**Phase 1 â€“ Foundations (Beginner)**

Week 1: GitHub setup, GitLab hello-world pipeline, InfoSec policy doc

Week 2: Map ISO 27001 â†’ NIST CSF controls, link to CI/CD stages

Week 3: Git workflows, merge request approvals, protected branches

**Phase 2 â€“ Automating Controls (Intermediate)**

Week 4: Policy as Code (IAM JSON, GitLab CI context)

Week 5: OPA/Rego basics, local checks + runner integration

Week 6: Terraform + OPA in review/staging/prod

Week 7: Evidence collection (AWS CLI + GitLab Security Dashboard)

**Phase 3 â€“ Automation & Dashboards (Advanced)**

Week 8: Automated evidence with GitHub/GitLab Actions

Week 9: Compliance dashboards (Python + GitLab Security outputs)

Week 10: Vendor risk automation (JSON schema + CI/CD scan evidence)

**Phase 4 â€“ Expert Level (GRC in Practice)**

Week 11: Control specifications embedded in CI/CD pipelines

Week 12: Multi-framework mapping (ISO â†” NIST â†” CIS â†” GitLab evidence)

Week 13: Evidence normalization (multi-cloud + GitLab artifacts)

Week 14: Final project: mini GRC automation platform
